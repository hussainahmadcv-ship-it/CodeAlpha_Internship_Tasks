# CodeAlpha Frontend Development Internship

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my internship project repository. I'm excited to share what I've been working on during my time with CodeAlpha.

## What I've Built

### Calculator App
I started with the classic—a calculator that actually works! It handles all your basic math needs: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done and taught me a lot about handling user input and managing state in JavaScript.

**Built with:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Image Gallery
Next up was an image gallery that looks good on any screen size. I wanted to create something clean and simple where images could shine without any clutter. The layout adapts smoothly whether you're on your phone or desktop.

**Built with:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Personal Portfolio Website
This one's close to my heart—my own portfolio site! It's where I get to show off what I've learned and the projects I've worked on. I focused on making it responsive and easy to navigate, with a design that feels both professional and approachable.

**Built with:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## What I'm Learning

This internship has been all about getting my hands dirty with real projects. I'm working on writing cleaner code, understanding how things actually work under the hood, and building stuff that people can use. Every task has pushed me a little further, and I'm enjoying the journey.

## About Me

I'm **Hussain Ahmad**, a frontend developer still finding my feet in this world of code. I love the creative side of development—turning ideas into something you can see and interact with in a browser. Always learning, always building.

## Repository Structure

Each task lives in its own folder with all the files you need to run it. I've tried to keep everything organized following CodeAlpha's submission guidelines.

A big thank you to **CodeAlpha** for giving me this opportunity to learn and grow. Let's keep building! 🚀
